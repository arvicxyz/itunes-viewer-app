# Introduction
This repository contains the iTunesViewer project. It's an Android mobile application called iTunes Viewer. This is the Kotlin version of coding-challenge-app repository. It's a movie and music app, but it doesn't let you watch movies nor let you listen to music. It's just an app that displays a list of items obtained from iTunes Search API and shows a detailed view for each item. The project applies MVVM architecture and its UI has a bit of material design with dark mode color palette implementation.
